# NGO Connect - Task Lifecycle Implementation Plan

## 🎯 PHASE 1: Backend API Extensions (Non-Breaking)

### New API Endpoints to Add:

#### 1. Attendance Management APIs
```
GET /api/attendance/tasks/today          # Get today's tasks for NGO
GET /api/attendance/task/:taskId         # Get volunteers for a specific task
POST /api/attendance/mark                # Mark attendance for volunteer
PUT /api/attendance/:id                  # Update attendance record
```

#### 2. Task Lifecycle APIs  
```
GET /api/tasks/lifecycle/:volunteerId    # Get volunteer's task lifecycle status
PUT /api/tasks/:taskId/status            # Update task status
POST /api/tasks/:taskId/complete         # Mark task as completed
```

#### 3. Certificate Management APIs
```
GET /api/certificates/eligible/:volunteerId    # Check certificate eligibility
POST /api/certificates/generate                # Generate certificate
GET /api/certificates/download/:certificateId  # Download certificate
POST /api/certificates/upload-template         # Upload custom certificate template
```

## 🎯 PHASE 2: Frontend UI Components (Additive)

### NGO Dashboard - New Tabs:
1. **Attendance Tab**
   - Today's tasks list
   - Volunteer attendance marking interface
   - Bulk attendance actions

2. **Certificates Tab**  
   - Upload certificate templates
   - View issued certificates
   - Certificate analytics

### Volunteer Dashboard - Enhanced:
1. **Task Tracking Tab**
   - Application → Upcoming → In-Progress → Completed flow
   - Status indicators with progress bar
   - Certificate download button (conditional)

## 🎯 PHASE 3: Business Logic Integration

### Task Status Auto-Updates:
1. **Date-based transitions**: Upcoming → In-Progress (on task date)
2. **Attendance-based transitions**: In-Progress → Completed (when marked present)
3. **Certificate eligibility**: Only Present + Completed volunteers

### Validation Rules:
- Attendance can only be marked on/after task date
- Certificates only generated for Present volunteers
- Status changes follow strict lifecycle rules

## 🛡️ Safety Measures:
1. **Feature Branch Development**: `git checkout -b feature/task-lifecycle`
2. **API Versioning**: Add new endpoints without changing existing ones
3. **Database Migrations**: Only additive changes
4. **Gradual UI Rollout**: Feature flags for new components
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each phase tested independently

## 📊 Implementation Priority:
1. ✅ Database models (Already exist!)
2. 🔄 Backend APIs (Next)
3. 🔄 NGO Attendance Tab (Then)
4. 🔄 Volunteer Tracking Tab (Then)  
5. 🔄 Certificate Management (Finally)

## 🎯 Estimated Timeline:
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours (Backend APIs)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 hours (Frontend Components)  
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 hours (Business Logic Integration)
- **Total**: ~6-9 hours of focused development

This approach ensures zero disruption to existing functionality while adding powerful new features!
